    h2#what What is Peaches 'n' Stink?
    p
        |Peaches 'n' Stink is an allow list(or whitelist) based internet forum with no moderation. 
        |You can only see posts and comments that are posted by users that you follow. 
        |However, if you're logged out or don't want to build a list then you can use someone else's list.

    h2#posts Posts
    p
        |Posts are the main way to submit content. 
        |All topics are allowed(unless illegal). 
        |You must be logged in to create a post. 
        |Use  
        a(href="/new") new post
        | 
        |in the site navigation to go to the create post form. 
        |Posts have a title, link, content and tags. 
        |Only title is required.

    h2#comments Comments
    p
        |You can write comments on posts and other comments. 
        |You must be logged in to create a comment. 
        |If you're logged in, then there's a comment form at the top of each post and comment page.

    h2#formatting Formatting
    p
        |There are two formatting rules for posts and comments:
        ol
            li
                |All newlines are automatically preserved.
            li
                |You can use 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |and 
                i ```
                | 
                |to preserve spaces/whitespace for a group of lines. 
                i ```pre
                | 
                |must come first on its own line and 
                i ```
                | 
                |must come last on its own line. 
                |All whitespace in between will be preserved. 
                |This is intended for writing computer programming source code.

    h2#tags Tags
    p
        |When you create a post you can assign tags to it. 
        |All the tags assigned to a post are displayed right after the post time; 
        |you can click these tags to go to that tag's page. 
        |All posts with the same tag are grouped together. 
        |For example, all posts tagged "meta" are available at 
        a(href="/r/meta") r/meta
        |.

    h2#following Following
    p
        |On the right side of usernames there is a plus or minus button. 
        |You can follow the respective user with the plus button. 
        |The minus button unfollows. 
        |You can only see posts and comments that have been posted by users that you're following. 
        |You can manage who you're following by using 
        a(href="/following") following
        | 
        |in the site navigation(if you're logged in).

    h2#settings Settings
    p
        |You can access the 
        a(href="/settings") settings
        | 
        |in the site navigation. 
        |You can use the settings even if you're logged out. 
        |The available settings are: time zone, allow list and view mode.
        |Time zone will adjust the time that is displayed for each post and comment. 
        |Allow list determines which list of users you use to reveal posts and comments; 
        |you can only see posts and comments made by users on your selected allow list.
        |View mode affects how posts and comments display that aren't from users on your selected allow list; 
        |"locked" completely hides these posts and comments, while "discover" will show these posts and comments but only with the username and time.
